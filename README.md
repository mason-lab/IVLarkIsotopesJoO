This github repository stores the scripts and data used to run the statistical analyses associated with the manuscript entitled "Agriculture induces isotopic shifts and niche contraction in Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris) of the southern Colorado Desert" 

Note that the script for generating the sampling map uses GADM shapefiles, which are too large to store on my github page, but can be easily obtained.
